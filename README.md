# Domain-Driven Design with ASP.NET Core

This repository contains my hands-on implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts while following the [LinkedIn Learning Course on DDD](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/...). 

The goal is to reinforce my understanding by building a clean, modular, and maintainable application based on DDD principles in ASP.NET Core.

## âœ… Topics Covered

- DDD fundamentals: Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Repositories
- Clean architecture layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation
- Entity Framework Core with rich domain models
- Domain Events and Ubiquitous Language
- Bounded Contexts and Aggregates

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core Web API
- C# 12
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server
- xUnit for testing

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Structuring projects with DDD patterns
- Applying tactical design (Aggregates, Value Objects)
- Building testable and decoupled applications
- Using domain events to capture business behavior

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Domain`: Core business logic
- `Application`: Use cases and services
- `Infrastructure`: Data access & implementations
- `WebAPI`: REST endpoints

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the project:
1. Clone the repo
2. Update connection string
3. Run migrations
4. Launch Web API

```bash
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run
